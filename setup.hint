ldesc: "PyORBit is a Python binding for the ORBit2 CORBA ORB. It was 
developped to suit the needs of the bonobo bindings in GNOME-Python, 
but is usable for other purposes as well. It aims to follow the 
standard Python language mapping for CORBA. It can generate stubs at 
runtime from typelibs, IDL files, or by introspecting remote objects 
using ORBit2's IModule typelib capabilities."
